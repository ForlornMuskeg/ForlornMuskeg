- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ForlornMuskeg (Umut Can Dundar);
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m actually electrical and electronics engineer but very interested in programming;
  
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently using c++ and working on some beginner, intermediate and advanced levels projects to
      improve myself in coding and I also keep learning advanced c++ systems, coding skills and
      particularly principles of software engineering;
     
- ðŸ“« I would appreciate it if you have any recommendations about my codes to make them more readable and
      maintainable or help me with getting into the software universe as a professional;

      Please contact me via my email umutcandundar97@gmail.com
